//! Data types for captured HTTP request and response information.

//! This module contains the core data structures used to represent captured
//! HTTP requests and responses, along with background task types.

/// Data captured from an HTTP request.
///
/// Contains all the information about an HTTP request that was captured by the middleware.
/// The body is optionally captured based on the configuration.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use outlet::types::RequestData;
/// use axum::http::{Method, Uri};
/// use std::time::SystemTime;
///
/// // This struct is typically created by the middleware, but you might
/// // encounter it in your RequestHandler implementation
/// ```

    /// HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
    pub method: Method,
    /// Request URI including path and query parameters

    pub body: Option<Bytes>,

/// Data captured from an HTTP response.
///
/// Contains all the information about an HTTP response that was captured by the middleware.
/// Includes timing information and optionally the response body.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use outlet::types::ResponseData;
/// use axum::http::StatusCode;
/// use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};
///
/// // This struct is typically created by the middleware, but you might
/// // encounter it in your RequestHandler implementation
/// ```

///
/// The middleware sends these tasks to a background async task for processing.
/// This allows the main request/response flow to continue without blocking.
